The code was run on the production server for the Offshore Geodesy Project
by John Desanto, and the results were copied to this directory.

The directory contains the following files:

- `script.csh`: The script used to run the code.
- `sol_out_NDP1_center_Ch_Mi_scale_xy_no_freed`:
    The solution out file that contains the run values,
    computation results, and residuals.
- `res_09_NDP1_center_Ch_Mi_scale_xy_no_freed`:
    The residuals file that contains the residuals for observation `09`.
- `res_10_NDP1_center_Ch_Mi_scale_xy_no_freed`:
    The residuals file that contains the residuals for observation `10`.
- `res_11_NDP1_center_Ch_Mi_scale_xy_no_freed`:
    The residuals file that contains the residuals for observation `11`.
