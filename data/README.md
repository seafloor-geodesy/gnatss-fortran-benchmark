# Input Data

This directory contains the input data to perform the inversion.

The directory contains the following files:

- `NDP1.master`:
    The configuration file for the inversion.
    This file is used by the Chadwell Fortran code but not GNATSS.
- `NDP1_Ch_Mi_2022_fit`:
    The sound speed profile file used to compute the harmonic mean,
    for both the Chadwell Fortran code and GNATSS.
- `NDP1_22a_tm.osu.tpxo72.2010`:
    Placeholder file for the tide model data.
    This file is not actually being used,
    but a required input data path for the Fortran code to run.
- `POS_FREED_TRANS_TWTT`:
    The GPS Positioning data file.
    It contains tranducer position time series generated
    from POS_TWTT time, XYZ position (m), position covariance matrix (m^2).
- `pxp_tt`:
    The travel times data, which has acoustic ranges to each transponder,
    in text column format: interrogation time,
    range to each transponder (microseconds, 0 if no reply).
- `deletns.dat`:
    The deletions file, which contains outliers to be removed from the inversion.
    This file was generated by the Chadwell Fortran code, with the addition of custom
    manual flagging.
